# Portfolio website using Flutter Web

A responsive layout; open-source, comment-rich, and clean codebase website built with Flutter web.

The codebase is open-source and rich in comments. Although you can use it any way you want, beware that it was inspired and cloned from an open-source repository by <a href="https://github.com/kamranbekirovyz">Kamran Bekirov</a>. So, in case of usage, I suggest you respect its original author.
